Hello Dude Taker!

The "index" file is a html file which contains your homepage. You could do two things:

1) Create multiple copies of index and use them as templates for separate pages in which you include content, e.g. Talks, Publications, etc.

2) Use sections and "id=section name" html function to make the buttons redirect the browser to a specific location/section on the same page (the index page).

You can edit the main.css file in the "assets/css" folder to give your webpage that salmon pink look! ;)

Enjoy!
